<h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Hello, I am Jiale Chen and I go by Jerry. I am a senior at The City College of New York, majoring in computer science and applied mathematics. I am interested in data science and exploring its appplications in different fields, such as finance and sustainability. Having a child living in me, I am ebullient to explore, learn, and grow; I take every opportunity that is presented to me to develop my technical skills while exploring my interests.
