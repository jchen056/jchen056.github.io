<h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Hello, I am <strong>Jiale Chen</strong> and I go by <b>Jerry</b>. I am a fourth-year <a href="https://macaulay.cuny.edu/" target="_blank"><b>Macaulay Honors</b></a> student at <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>The City College of New York</strong></a>, majoring in computer science and applied mathematics. I am interested in <strong>data science</strong> and exploring its appplications in different fields, such as finance and sustainability. Having a child living in me, I am ebullient to explore, learn, and grow; I take every opportunity that is presented to me to develop my technical skills while exploring my interests.
