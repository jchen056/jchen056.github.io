<h1>Education</h1>

<section>
  <p>Molded by adversity after arriving in the United States at the age of 15, I persevered and graduated from Newtown High School with an Advanced Regents Diploma with Honors and Mastery in Math and Science. As a member of CCNY’s Macaulay Honors College at CCNY, I am currently pursuing my BSc in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.
