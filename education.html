    <h1>Education</h1>

    <section class="intro">
      <p>Molded by adversity after arriving in the United States at the age of 15, 
    I persevered and graduated from <b>Newtown High School</b> with an Advanced Regents Diploma with Honors and Mastery in Math and Science. 
    As a member of <b>Macaulay Honors College</b> at CCNY, 
    I am currently pursuing my BSc in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.
